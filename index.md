# LTL2Action



## Environment

The environment is implemented with [gym-minigrid](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid): an agent (red triangle) must navigate in a 7x7 map. There are walls (grey squares), goals (colored squares) and doors (blue rectangles). The actions are go straight on, turn left, turn right and the observations returned are the 7x7 colored grid and the orientation of the agent codified by an integer.
